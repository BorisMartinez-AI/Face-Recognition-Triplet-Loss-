# Face-Recognition with Triplet-Loss
Face Recognition algorithm built with FaceNet.
Very simple face-recognition algorithm using the technique of Triple Loss which compares anchor images with positive and negative images. Model used a pretrained 
Neural Network to encode face images into vectors and facilitate comparisons.
